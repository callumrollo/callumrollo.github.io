&lt;p&gt;I have face blindness (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prosopagnosia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) "a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_disorder" title="Cognitive disorder"&gt;cognitive disorder&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception" title="Face perception"&gt;face perception&lt;/a&gt; in which the ability to recognize familiar faces including one's own face (self-recognition), is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g., object discrimination) and intellectual functioning (e.g., &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making" title="Decision-making"&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt;) remain intact". It has a prevalence of roughly 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only found out that this was a medical condition a few years ago from my mother, who also has it&lt;sup id="sf-faceblind-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-faceblind-1" class="simple-footnote" title=' this is not unusual. The wikipeida article states that many people do not realise that they have face blindness until later in life. It has also been suggested that a genetic factor is responsible for the condition. "Many adults with developmental prosopagnosia report that for a long time they had no idea that they had a deficit in face processing, unaware that others could distinguish people solely on facial differences"'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.Putting a name to something is powerful. Not knowing what face blindness was, I had struggled and developed ad-hoc systems for dealing with it over time. As is common for people with face blindness, I am highly dependant on context clues to identify people. Meet a colleague at the supermarket? They are a stranger to me. A gym buddy in the streeet? ditto. Friend gets a haircut? Total reset. I have kept and abandoned dozens of lists on my phone trying to retain names and tie them to non- facial aspects. Here's a sample of a current one from my kickboxing gym (&lt;a href="https://www.ironmanmajorna.se/"&gt;Ironman Majorna&lt;/a&gt; if you wanna come train!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anna - floppy hair youth. Super fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bert - The Beast. hexagonal tattoo on shoulder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carl - serious Black coach with good music &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dani - regular, skilled very light punch, blond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elinor - nice bald shaved older 1.85 80 kg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frank - classic Kickboxer Guy short blond hair. Serious. Bad block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Godot - the gymnast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harriet - cropped blond hair, spin kick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how none of these depend on facial features and a lot of it is context specific (I'm probably not gonna identify a guy with a good spin kick on the tram). I also depend a lot on haircuts, so please don't change yours. After Bert shaved I though there was another overpowered hitter to survive sparring with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N.B.&lt;/strong&gt; names have been changed throughout this article. If you think you recognise yourself in one of these stories, sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My experience of this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face blindness is a cause of substantial background anxiety. My inability to recognise people often puts me in unfortunate social situations and I worry that I frequently come across as rude/dismissive when I blank someone I have previously met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My face blindness has also lead to some amusing situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a gig, I met my friend Abe and, for the first time, his new girlfriend Beatrice. After exchanging some comments about the band with Abe, and having not been introduced to Beatrice, I offered my hand to shake, said "Hi, I'm Callum" and continued the conversation. Some 15 minutes later I realised, from a peculiarity of her accent, that Beatrice was a friend of mine. In fact, she and Abe had met at a dinner at my house some weeks prior. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About a year into my work at VOTO, I was the first arrival at the office that morning. Locking up my bike I saw a woman standing in front of the office attempting to make eye contact with me to initiate conversation. Being a socially anxious person, I blanked her and proceeded to unlock the office and walk in. This woman turned out to be Carla, someone I had met in work meetings over zoom and several times in person in social situations. She later forgave this supreme act of rudeness and has become a dear friend. I wouldn't rule out this happening again though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During summer holidays at the end of my first year of university, I was working my summer job rowing the Southwold/Walberswick ferry. A man my age boarded with his parents. He greated me by name and spoke about several topics before I realised he must be a university classmate. My class was 25 people. Once I returned to uni, I only found out who it was after someone else mentioned that coincidental encounter with Dave. Seeing him in context had not jogged my memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While conducting field work in the Canaries, I approached a man in a hotel lobby and asked him about how we were getting to the lab that day. He was not, in fact, my colleague, but a complete stranger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nearly all of these encounters I have been able to hide my lack of recognition. I think most people just find it so unlikely that someone they know relatively well would not recognise them that it is not even something they consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading some of the anecdotes on the original face blindness website &lt;a href="http://www.choisser.com/faceblind/"&gt;choisser.com&lt;/a&gt; I seem to have a mercifully mild version of face blindness. Statistically, I am sure, friendships have faltered, professional relationships never bloomed and many people have felt offended and put down by my failure to recognise them. This is a real shame and there are many past events I wish I could go back and rectify. More alarming to me are the many misses I was never even aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a name for this condition, I can be up-front about it with people. I no longer have to think of half excuses (I didn't have my glasses! I was in a hurry! I was listening to a really good podcast! (though these were likely contributing factors)). I hope that this increases awareness of face blindness. Maybe somewhere down the line a social interaction will be saved when someone like me fails to recognise someone who they should. This post is partially an effort to increase awareness of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some side effects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realising that I suffer from an identifiable medical condition has allowed me to explain quite a few seemingly unrelated issues that I have long struggled with. Some of these are obvious (Failing to recognise classmates and colleagues in different contexts, ) others less so. Here are some of the less obvious effects of my face blindness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot identify/visualise family resemblance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More broadly - I can't identify when people "look similar"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot picture people in my head - typically old photographs I have seen many times come to mind instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sometimes do not identify myself in group photographs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I struggle differentiating characters in films, especially if they all have similar clothes (legal thrillers, war films etc.) If a character changes hairstyle/clothes I often think they are a new character&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am often anxious in situations where I will meet new people (though, aren't we all?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a child I frequently got lost/lost track of my parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was very late to an understanding/appreciation of beauty standards, the effects of makeup etc. I couldn't say until I was in my late teens who was attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot connect/identify people in old childhood photographs, photos of celebrities before they were famous etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may additionally explain why I struggled making friends as a child. Or maybe I just had bad vibes idk&lt;sup id="sf-faceblind-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-faceblind-2" class="simple-footnote" title='Prosopagnosia in children may be overlooked; they may just appear to be very shy or slightly odd due to their inability to recognize faces." lol'&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Further reading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good narrative style Wired article, you know the type &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/11/blind/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2006/11/blind/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a bunch of papers in the footnotes of the wikipedia article if you really want to go deep on this. I didn't find much new in the ones I skimmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
