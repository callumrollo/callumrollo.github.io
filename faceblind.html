    <h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>I have face blindness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia"><strong>Prosopagnosia</strong></a>) "a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_disorder" title="Cognitive disorder">cognitive disorder</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception" title="Face perception">face perception</a> in which the ability to recognize familiar faces including one's own face (self-recognition), is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g., object discrimination) and intellectual functioning (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making" title="Decision-making">decision-making</a>) remain intact". It has a prevalence of roughly 2 percent.</p>
<p>I only found out that this was a medical condition a few years ago from my mother, who also has it<sup id="sf-faceblind-1-back"><a href="#sf-faceblind-1" class="simple-footnote" title=' this is not unusual. The wikipeida article states that many people do not realise that they have face blindness until later in life. It has also been suggested that a genetic factor is responsible for the condition. "Many adults with developmental prosopagnosia report that for a long time they had no idea that they had a deficit in face processing, unaware that others could distinguish people solely on facial differences"'>1</a></sup>.Putting a name to something is powerful. Not knowing what face blindness was, I had struggled and developed ad-hoc systems for dealing with it over time. As is common for people with face blindness, I am highly dependant on context clues to identify people. Meet a colleague at the supermarket? They are a stranger to me. A gym buddy in the streeet? ditto. Friend gets a haircut? Total reset. I have kept and abandoned dozens of lists on my phone trying to retain names and tie them to non- facial aspects. Here's a sample of a current one from my kickboxing gym (<a href="https://www.ironmanmajorna.se/">Ironman Majorna</a> if you wanna come train!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Anna - floppy hair youth. Super fast</li>
<li>Bert - The Beast. hexagonal tattoo on shoulder</li>
<li>Carl - serious Black coach with good music </li>
<li>Dani - regular, skilled very light punch, blond</li>
<li>Elinor - nice bald shaved older 1.85 80 kg</li>
<li>Frank - classic Kickboxer Guy short blond hair. Serious. Bad block</li>
<li>Godot - the gymnast</li>
<li>Harriet - cropped blond hair, spin kick</li>
</ul>
<p>Note how none of these depend on facial features and a lot of it is context specific (I'm probably not gonna identify a guy with a good spin kick on the tram). I also depend a lot on haircuts, so please don't change yours. For two weeks after Bert shaved I though there was another overpowered hitter to survive sparring with.</p>
<p><strong>N.B.</strong> names have been changed throughout this article. If you think you recognise yourself in one of these stories, sorry!</p>
<h3>My experience of this</h3>
<p>Face blindness is a cause of substantial background anxiety. My inability to recognise people often puts me in unfortunate social situations and I worry that I frequently come across as rude/dismissive when I blank someone I have previously met. </p>
<p>My face blindness has also lead to some amusing situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>At a gig, I met my friend Abe and, for the first time, his new girlfriend Beatrice. After exchanging some comments about the band with Abe, and having not been introduced to Beatrice, I offered my hand to shake, said "Hi, I'm Callum" and continued the conversation. Some 15 minutes later I realised, from a peculiarity of her accent, that Beatrice was a friend of mine. In fact, she and Abe had met at a dinner at my house some weeks prior. </li>
<li>About a year into my work at VOTO, I was the first arrival at the office that morning. Locking up my bike I saw a woman standing in front of the office attempting to make eye contact with me to initiate conversation. Being a socially anxious person, I blanked her and proceeded to unlock the office and walk in. This woman turned out to be Carla, someone I had met in work meetings over zoom and several times in person in social situations. She later forgave this supreme act of rudeness and has become a dear friend. I wouldn't rule out this happening again though.</li>
<li>During summer holidays at the end of my first year of university, I was working my summer job rowing the Southwold/Walberswick ferry. A man my age boarded with his parents. He greated me by name and spoke about several topics before I realised he must be a university classmate. My class was 25 people. Once I returned to uni, I only found out who it was after someone else mentioned that coincidental encounter with Dave. Seeing him in context had not jogged my memory.</li>
<li>While conducting field work in the Canaries, I approached a man in a hotel lobby and asked him about how we were getting to the lab that day. He was not, in fact, my colleague, but a complete stranger.</li>
</ol>
<p>In nearly all of these encounters I have been able to hide my lack of recognition. I think most people just find it so unlikely that someone they know relatively well would not recognise them that it is not even something they consider.</p>
<p>Reading some of the anecdotes on the original face blindness website <a href="http://www.choisser.com/faceblind/">choisser.com</a> I seem to have a mercifully mild version of face blindness. Statistically, I am sure, friendships have faltered, professional relationships never bloomed and many people have felt offended and put down by my failure to recognise them. This is a real shame and there are many past events I wish I could go back and rectify. More alarming to me are the many misses I was never even aware of.</p>
<p>Now that I have a name for this condition, I can be up-front about it with people. I no longer have to think of half excuses (I didn't have my glasses! I was in a hurry! I was listening to a really good podcast! (though these were likely contributing factors)). I hope that this increases awareness of face blindness. Maybe somewhere down the line a social interaction will be saved when someone like me fails to recognise someone who they should. This post is partially an effort to increase awareness of this condition.</p>
<h3>Some side effects</h3>
<p>Realising that I suffer from an identifiable medical condition has allowed me to explain quite a few seemingly unrelated issues that I have long struggled with. Here are some of the less obvious effects of my face blindness:</p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot identify/visualise family resemblance</li>
<li>More broadly - I can't identify when people "look similar"</li>
<li>I cannot picture people in my head - typically old photographs I have seen many times come to mind instead</li>
<li>I sometimes do not identify myself in group photographs</li>
<li>I struggle differentiating characters in films, especially if they all have similar clothes (legal thrillers, war films etc.) If a character changes hairstyle/clothes I may think they are a new character</li>
<li>I am often anxious in situations where I will meet new people (though, aren't we all?)</li>
<li>As a child I frequently got lost/lost track of my parents</li>
<li>I was very late to an understanding/appreciation of beauty standards, the effects of makeup etc. I couldn't say until I was in my late teens who was attractive.</li>
<li>I cannot connect/identify people in old childhood photographs, photos of celebrities before they were famous etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may additionally explain why I struggled making friends as a child. Or maybe I just had bad vibes idk<sup id="sf-faceblind-2-back"><a href="#sf-faceblind-2" class="simple-footnote" title='Prosopagnosia in children may be overlooked; they may just appear to be very shy or slightly odd due to their inability to recognize faces." lol'>2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Coda</h3>
<p>Writing this has been quite cathartic. I don't know if it will be of help to others, face blindness is a fairly widely acknowledged condition these days. If you struggle recognising people, especially in unexpected contexts, perhaps it affects you too!</p>
<p>Sorry I didn't recognise you last time we met! Hope this explains it.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<ul>
<li>A good narrative style Wired article, you know the type <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/11/blind/">https://www.wired.com/2006/11/blind/</a></li>
<li>There's a bunch of papers in the footnotes of the wikipedia article if you really want to go deep on this. I didn't find much new in the ones I skimmed.</li>
