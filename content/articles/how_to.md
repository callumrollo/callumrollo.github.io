Summary: How to build this website

You may look at this content-poor, lazily formatted website and think "wow, I want one of those!". If so, I have good news for you. The steps to build this website are laid out in the [github repo](https://github.com/callumrollo/callumrollo.github.io).

Very little programming expertise is required. As long as you are comfortable creating a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) and a [GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/create-a-repo), the rest is ludicrously simple. 

I spent an excessive amount of time looking for academic sites to emulate/shamelessly copy before making this one. There are some great sites out there that provide all their source code online. I highly recommend finding one you like; imitation is, after all, the highest form of flattery. Here are some samples:
