Summary: Gaining access to real time autonomout platform locations

Last month, I managed to gain access to data I shouldn't have. After confirming the exploit was viable, I reported it to the software vendor and the vulnerability was patched within a couple of days. This was quite an exhilarating experience. While the memories are fresh, I will document the steps I took to get here.

I am not a computer security expert. My programming skills are mediocore at best and I have never tried to gain access to someone elses network. This exploit arose from my attempts to automate a tedious set of downloads.

# Background
The main sources of data for my work are submarine gliders. These are small (~ 2 m long, 50 kg) autonomous underwater robots that use a buoyancy engine and small wings/fins to navigate the ocean, diving up and down in a sawtooth pattern. Every few hours, these gliders call in over a satelllite connection to recieve new instructions. For the gliders we use, communication is handled through a dedicated webserver maintained by the manufacturer.

Each pilot has a login that gives them control over only their own gliders. Different reserach groups and organisations have their own fleets of gliders that they control. 

# The Goal

I wanted to estimate the currents at the sea surface. I know that the glider send back multiple GPS fixes during their calls, and this data is wirtten to a file on the webserver. When you are logged in and looking at the glider control panel, you can press a button to download this file. I could do this manually, but downloading the file for each of our gliders (we typically have ~ 4 out) every few hours would quickloy become tedious. So I did what any lazy scientist with a bit of shell scripting knowledge would do: some quick and dirty automation

# Automating the request
You can see what a browers is doing behind the scenes with a nifty little tool called "Inpect Element"

# Lessons
Security is hard. It's not something that scientists typically think of. In many ways, we are still living on the interent like it's the early days of the LHC. Back at the dawn of the internet, when it was only scientists, government agencies and very well resourced nerds, no systems were secured. There was no need. Even today, many scientists share data using unsecured FTP servers. Custom written, outdated and insecure software is the norm. We share passwords and typically rely on security by obscurity to keep us safe.

This post owes a lot to "Alex" over at [themangozone](https://mango.pdf.zone/). Alex has some very amusing and informative blog posts dealing with online security.


I have been interested in computer security for some time. My day to day work involves managing data flows through several cloud servers, maintaining website and data portals and controlling autonomous platforms in the ocean over the internet.

For a couple of years I have been an avid listener of the [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) podcast. An excellent way to learn about computer security, social engineering, hacking and data breaches. Coincidently, I had put pu a Darknet Diaries sticker on my laptop the day before discovering this vulrability. I don't know what Jack puts in the glue of those stickers but it must be some powerful stuff.
