Summary: Reasons why I occasionally write


I found this article by Cory Doctorow compelling https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/21/blockheads-r-us/

We do not write, or create any art, for financial reasons. We create for the act of creation and that our thoughts may reach others.

As Cory expresses with his usual passion and eloquence, when we write, we write to express ourselves first, and for others to read and be affected by our words second. The profit motive is entirely absent from these drivers.

A good friend of mine bought a typewriter recently. What a beautiful thing. Is it hackneyed and overdone? Yes. Is it kind of cringe? Absolutely! But it is beautiful.
