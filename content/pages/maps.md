Summary: Useful map data

I am a big fan of maps (see my [post on leaflet maps with Python]({filename}/articles/flask_leaflet.md)). I have collected various useful map files that I will share here. One day I might include a leaflet map here as well which collects all this data. But then this wouldn't be a pure clean static site anymore...

### Useful files

I use maps.me offline maps for android as my primary navigation tool. You can import these .kml files easily as bookmarks. Alternatively, you can convert them to GPX files for use with e.g. oruxmaps.

- bohusleden [homepage](https://www.westswedentrails.com/en/delled/bohusleden) 350 km of trails that wind from Gothenburg up to the Norwegian border. I've only hiked the southern ~ 100 km [download route as kml file](https://callumrollo.com/files/bohusleden.kml) 
- pilgrimsleden [homepage](https://www.vastsverige.com/mellerud/produkter/pilgrimsleden/) Lovely 3-4 day hike ending in Åmål. Good in winter as well. [Download route as kml file](https://callumrollo.com/files/Pilgrimsleden-Norra-Dalsland.kml). 
- vindskyddskartan [vindskyddskartan.se](https://vindskyddskartan.se/en/) . Incredibly useful resource. Over 4000 windshelters in Sweden that you can sleep in for free, no booking required. [download all locations of windshelters as kml file](https://callumrollo.com/files/vindskyddskartan.kml)

- gravel trails around Gothenburg . This is a files copied from mollbrink.se, described below. [Download all roads as kml file](https://callumrollo.com/files/vindskyddskartan.kml) Warning! This file is > 200 MB


### Cool sites

- [https://gpx2kml.com](https://gpx2kml.com) convert between GPX and KML formats
- [Gravel cycling in dalsland](https://www.vastsverige.com/en/dalsland/cycling/gravel-cycling/) has GPX files to some cool gravel riding near me. I should check it out
- Lots of gravel data available on [mollbrink.se](https://www.mollbrink.se/). The author has extracted all the gravel maps in Sweden from OSM data.
