Summary: Useful map data

I am a big fan of maps (see my [post on leaflet maps with Python]({filename}/articles/flask_leaflet.md)). I have collected various useful map files that I will share here. One day I might include a leaflet map here as well which collects all this data. But then this wouldn't be a pure clean static site anymore...

### Useful files

- bohusleden
- vindskyddskartan
- kattegatleden
- gravel maps


### Cool sites

- [https://gpx2kml.com](https://gpx2kml.com) convert between GPX and KML formats
- [Gravel cycling in dalsland](https://www.vastsverige.com/en/dalsland/cycling/gravel-cycling/) has GPX files to some cool gravel riding near me. I should check it out
