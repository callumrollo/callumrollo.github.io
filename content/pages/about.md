Summary: About the author

Since late 2021, I work as a data scientist at [Voice of the Ocean foundation (VOTO)](https://voiceoftheocean.org/en). I am responsible for processing, correcting, standardising and distributing scientific data from our fleet of autonomous platforms. In my day-to-day work, I build and monitor pipelines for processing near real time data, maintain servers and create websites for viewing/interrogating data. I also work with other data managers at organisations like [SMHI](https://www.smhi.se/en),  [EMODnet](https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en) and [IOOS/NOAA](https://ioos.noaa.gov/)to standardise and efficiently distribute data.

I work a lot with [ERDDAP](https://github.com/ERDDAP/erddap), a data broker server that makes it much easier to share well standardised oceanographic data. I manage the [VOTO ERDDAP](https://erddap.observations.voiceoftheocean.org/erddap/index.html) where all our data are hosted. I have co-organised and presented several in person and online webinars teaching data users and admins how to best use ERDDAP for distributing oceanographic data.

I am a Pythonista and proponent of free software for science. Several of my projects are available on my [github](https://github.com/callumrollo). I have completed collaborative programming projects as part of [OceanHackWeek](https://callumrollo.github.io/hackweek.html) and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). During my PhD, I led the [UEA scientific python](https://ueapy.github.io/) group.

### PhD

During 2017-2021 I completed a PhD at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK. I work with marine gliders, specifically the integration on Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) onto gliders to directly measure currents in the ocean.

Data and live location information from this glider, and others in the fleet, is available on the [UEA glider website](https://ueaglider.uea.ac.uk). I rebuilt the website in 2021, based on the original by [Bastien Queste](http://byqueste.com/).

[Prof. Karen Heywood](https://people.uea.ac.uk/k_heywood), [Dr. Rob Hall](https://people.uea.ac.uk/robert_hall), [Dr. Alex Phillips](https://www.noc.ac.uk/people/abp)

### Academic background

Integrated Master of Science (MSci) geophysics with study abroad First class, University of Southampton, UK. Included a year studying at Utrecht University, Netherlands under the Erasmus program

Thesis title: Approximating 3D seismic velocities under Sumatra using ambient noise tomography.
Supervisor: Dr Nicholas Harmon
