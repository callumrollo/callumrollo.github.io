Summary: About the author

As of late 2021, I work as a data scientist at [Voice of the Ocean foundation (VOTO)](https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/). I am responsible for processing, correcting, standardising and distributing scientific data from our fleet of autonomous platforms. In my day-to-day work, I build and monitor pipelines for processing near real time data, maintain servers and create websites for viewing/interrogating data. I also work with other data managers at organisations like [SMHI](https://www.smhi.se/en),  [EMODnet](https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en) and [IOOS/NOAA](https://ioos.noaa.gov/)to standardise and efficiently distribute data.

I work a lot with [ERDDAP](https://github.com/ERDDAP/erddap), a data broker server that makes it much easier to share well standardised oceanographic data. I manage the [VOTO ERDDAP](https://erddap.observations.voiceoftheocean.org/erddap/index.html) where all our data are hosted. I have co-organised and presented several in person and online webinars teaching data users and admins how to best use ERDDAP for distributing oceanographic data.

I am a Pythonista and proponent of free software for science. Several of my projects are available on my [github](https://github.com/callumrollo). I have completed collaborative programming projects as part of [OceanHackWeek]({filename}/articles/hackweek.md) and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). During my PhD, I led the [UEA scientific python](https://ueapy.github.io/) group.

### PhD

I completed a PhD at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK during 2017-2021. I work with marine gliders, specifically the integration on Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) onto gliders to directly measure currents in the ocean. During my time at UEA I took part in several field campaigns in the North Sea, tropical North Atlantic and Amundsen Sea.

Data and live location information from the glider I worked with (SG637), and others in the fleet, is available on the [UEA glider website](https://ueaglider.uea.ac.uk). I rebuilt the website in 2021, based on the original by [Bastien Queste](https://www.flow-lab.org/).
