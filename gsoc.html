  <div>
    <p>Today I got some great news, I have been accepted onto the Google Summer of Code program! You can see my project <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4657854750916608">here</a>. I'm really excited for this project, it feels quite unreal though. Google will be paying me (albiet, not much) to write code. I don't feel remotely qualified for this. I completed a three day intro to Python, copied a bunch of code from stack overflow and muddled my way through some projects on GitHub and now this. I'll give this project my all, but it feels distinctly weird that I've made it this far.</p>
<p>While the imposter syndrome takes root, I'm going to write down the steps that took me here. It may be of use to some other lost oceanographic coding nerd someday.</p>
<h1>The origin</h1>
<p>I did not grow up soldering together an Apple ][ in my parents basement, alas. Nor was I inspired to mod my first person shooter games to pwn n00bs online. In fact I had no coding experience beyond some traumatic Linux reinstallations until the second year of my undergraduate degree. My first taste of programming was creating maps of earthquakes using gmt and parsing data with trail and error changes to a single line <code>sed</code> command provided by a lecturer. It was a frustrating, but ultimately rewarding experience as I figured out how to make the computer do the repetitive tasks of geophysics. The power of a simple for-loop was far more alluring than the more prosaic methods of pencil and compass in our structural geology seminars.</p>
<p>This course also introduced me to the joys of multi-user Linux systems and how cunning use of <code>cd</code> and your smarter friend's username (helpfully identical to their university email) could be used to compare homework solutions.</p>
<p>This foray into classic and still widely used geophysical tools was rounded out by a course in FORTRAN 77 at Utrecht Univeristy, modelling planetary density and gravity profiles. After this course I was hooked. Never again would I compute something by hand when <em>the computer can do it better</em>.</p>
<p>In typical university fashion, my MSci project was centered around using a convoluted series of MATLAB scripts far beyond my understanding to Do Science. In my case, this was analyzing a seismic dataset to reconstruct sound velocites of subsurface rock units. This was a lot of fun, particularly plotting the results, but the scripts passed down from my supervisor were a black box to me. I did not experience the "aha!" moments of using a wildcard in a bash script, or an environment variable in a for loop.</p>
<h1>Development and FOSS</h1>
<p>Beginning my PhD in oceanography, I began by using the tool most familiar to me and used by research group, namely MATLAB. 6 months into my studies however, I had a transformational experience in the form of an introductory Python course organised by the great Denis Sergeev. In three short days I was introduced to a beautiful open language, and a wider ecosystem of open source. I took a month to convert my work to date into Python and haven't looked back since. Being taught the methods of open source made me a user of Linux, not just as a free alternative to Windows, but as a tool of liberation.</p>
<h1>Learner to developer</h1>
<p>... tbc once I've got some sleep!</p>
